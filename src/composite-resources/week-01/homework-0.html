# Introduce yourself

Take the time to write a short (1 paragraph or so) introduction for yourself, and post it as a followup to the "Introductions" post on Piazza. Also reply to at least 2 other folks, to get to know them a bit. You're going to be learning and working with about half the people who are in this class, and now is your chance to say hello to them!

# Setup

In this class you will keep your homework assignments in a Google Drive folder, for which you must grant edit access to the staff:

* [cthunn@eecs.berkeley.edu](mailto:cthunn@eecs.berkeley.edu)
* [sequoia@berkeley.edu](mailto:sequoia@berkeley.edu)
* [btong@berkeley.edu](mailto:btong@berkeley.edu)

Please grant us access to the whole folder at once, rather than granting us access to each assignment individually. Also, keep in mind that week's homework assignment should correspond to one Google Doc within your homework folder. For example, you should write your responses to the following questions in a single Google Doc called "HW 01".

# Case study on the Socratic method

Read [The Socratic Method: Teaching by Asking Instead of by Telling](http://www.garlikov.com/Soc_Meth.html) and answer the following questions:

1. Why was this exercise effective in this instance? List your reasons and provide supporting examples.
2. Could you apply this to your own teaching (lab assisting, tutoring, or discussion)? Is there anything that you would have to change in order to use this technique effectively in the context of your own teaching?
3. Along the same lines, what are some of the limitations of this method? What are some challenges to using this teaching technique in a different setting?
