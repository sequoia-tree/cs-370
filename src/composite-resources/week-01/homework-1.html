<h1 id="read-our-policies">Read our policies</h1>
<p>I strongly recommend reading through the entire <a href="{{ url_for('render_policies') }}">policies page</a>, since it is not very long. Here are the highlights:</p>
<ul>
<li>First and foremost, join Slack. You can find the invite <a href="{{ url_for('render_policies') }}#slack">here</a>, along with the associated policies.</li>
<li>Then read about your <a href="{{ url_for('render_policies') }}#tutoring">teaching requirement</a>. If you have any questions, ask them in the #tutoring channel on Slack.</li>
<li>And last but not least, familiarize yourself with <a href="{{ url_for('render_policies') }}#grading">the rubric</a>. Note the emphasis on participation and citizenship. This will be the most selective part of your grade, and to get a good score you'll have to contribute frequent, insightful comments both in class and on Slack.</li>
</ul>
<h1 id="introduce-yourself">Introduce yourself</h1>
<p>Take the time now to write a short (one paragraph or so) introduction for yourself, and post it in the #random channel on Slack. Also reply to at least two other folks, to get to know them a bit. You're going to be learning and working with about half the people who are in this class, and now is your chance to say hello to them!</p>
<p>Please also add a profile picture on Slack by clicking your name and then "edit profile". This will make it easier for your classmates to remember you.</p>
<h1 id="make-a-homework-folder">Make a homework folder</h1>
<p>In this class you will keep your homework assignments in a Google Drive folder, for which you must grant edit access to the staff:</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="mailto:cthunn@eecs.berkeley.edu">cthunn@eecs.berkeley.edu</a></li>
<li><a href="mailto:sequoia@berkeley.edu">sequoia@berkeley.edu</a></li>
<li><a href="mailto:btong@berkeley.edu">btong@berkeley.edu</a></li>
</ul>
<p>Please grant us access to the whole folder at once, rather than granting us access to each assignment individually. Also, keep in mind that each week's homework assignment should correspond to one Google Doc within your homework folder. For example, you should write your responses to the following questions in a single Google Doc called "HW {{ week.number }}".</p>
<h1 id="case-study-on-the-socratic-method">Case study on the Socratic method</h1>
<p>Read <a href="http://www.garlikov.com/Soc_Meth.html">The Socratic Method: Teaching by Asking Instead of by Telling</a> and answer the following questions:</p>
<ol>
<li>Why was this exercise effective in this instance? List your reasons and provide supporting examples.</li>
<li>Could you apply this to your own teaching (lab assisting, tutoring, or discussion)? Is there anything that you would have to change in order to use this technique effectively in the context of your own teaching?</li>
<li>Along the same lines, what are some of the limitations of this method? What are some challenges to using this teaching technique in a different setting?</li>
</ol>
