<p>
  Make a post in the #readings channel on Slack, discussing one of the following readings or responding to a post by one of your peers. You should lend something new and useful to the conversion. (For example you could explain how to apply something that you learned, or offer an argument for / against one of your peers' ideas. Any input is welcome, as long as it is original and respectful.)
</p>

<p>
  Also feel free to find a different article on your own, and respond to that instead of one of the readings. Just be sure to provide a link to it, so others can read it too.
