<h1 id="journal-prompt">Journal prompt</h1>

<p>
  Respond to the prompts below, immediately after each of your appointments this week (discussion, group tutoring, or one-on-one tutoring). When you finish your last appointment, copy and paste your journal entry onto bCourses.
</p>

<ul>
  <li>Briefly summarize the appointment. (For example: How do you feel about it? Do you think the student was following? What signs let you pick up on this? What could you have done better? etc.)</li>
</ul>

<ul>
<li>
<p>Recall the problems you covered with your students this week. Were some problems more effective than others, for getting across a particular poin? If so, what made those problems better?</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>How did you assess the student's (or students') knowledge base at the beginning of the session? How did you tailor you appointment to their level of understanding? Do you think you did a good job targeting their comfort zone with the material? Provide an example or two to support your reflection.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>What was the focus of this appointment? A particular topic, midterm prep, or something else perhaps? How was this reflected in the structure of the appointment? Was it effective? Provide some examples.</p>
</li>
</ul>

<p>
  Then take the time to read some of your peers' responses too, and reply to at least two of them. Lend something productive and insightful to the conversation. (For example, talk about what you would've done differently in their position, or whether you're going to adapt something similar for your own lessons. Maybe ask them something about their appointment, etc.)
</p>

<h1 id="review">Review</h1>

<p>
  After each appointment this week which you plan to count toward your <a href="{{ url_for('render_policies') }}#tutoring">teaching requirement</a>, compose an email that includes the following points. Then send it to the student(s) who attended. Also include a copy of your email in a document called "Review {{ week.number }}" in your homework folder.
</p>

<ul><li>A recap of what you taught.</li></ul>
<ul><li>Some resources you think your student(s) would benefit from studying. (Please consider carefully which resources you send them. In particular, what level of understanding do you want to target, and regarding what topics?) If you will see the same student(s) again, ask them to read and complete the relevant resources before then.</li></ul>
<ul><li>A link to the feedback form: <a href="{{ TUTORING_FEEDBACK }}">{{ TUTORING_FEEDBACK }}</a>.</li></ul>
