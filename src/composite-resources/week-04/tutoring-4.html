  Here's the tutoring sign-up form for this week: <a href="{{ week.signup }}">{{ week.signup }}</a>. You must email your students by Saturday night.
</p>

<h1 id="assignment">Assignment</h1>

<ul>
<li>
<p>Before your appointment, come up some counterexamples for three or more common misconceptions regarding the concept you're teaching. (Recall from lecture the principles of a good counterexample â€” simple, memorable, and easily interpretable, to name a few.) Share these with your student(s) whenever is appropriate during your lesson.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Be vigilant of misconceptions this week, like we learned in lecture!</p>
<ul>
<li>Always ask students to justify their reasoning, whether they're right or wrong.</li>
<li>If they don't get the right answer <em>and</em> correctly justify it, then use a counterexample to identify whether they have a misconception.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>

<h1 id="journal-prompt">Journal prompt</h1>

<p>
  Respond to the prompts below, immediately after each of your appointments this week (discussion, group tutoring, or one-on-one tutoring). When you finish your last appointment, copy and paste your journal entry onto bCourses.
</p>

<ul>
  <li>Briefly summarize the appointment. (For example: How do you feel about it? Do you think the student was following? What signs let you pick up on this? What could you have done better? etc.)</li>
</ul>

<ul>
<li>
<p>How did your student(s) react to the counterexamples you brainstormed before the appointment? Were they useful in illustrating concepts or catching misconceptions? How could your counterexamples have been better?</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Did you identify any misconceptions during the appointment? If so, how? And how did you correct them? Provide some specific examples.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>At any point during your appointment, did you assume the student knew something they didn't? How did you course-correct? What can you do in the future to steer clear of expert blindness?</p>
</li>
</ul>

<p>
  Then take the time to read some of your peers' responses too, and reply to at least two of them. Lend something productive and insightful to the conversation. (For example, talk about what you would've done differently in their position, or whether you're going to adapt something similar for your own lessons. Maybe ask them something about their appointment, etc.)
</p>

<h1 id="review">Review</h1>

<p>
  After each appointment this week which you plan to count toward your <a href="{{ url_for('render_policies') }}#tutoring">teaching requirement</a>, compose an email that includes the following points. Then send it to the student(s) who attended. Also include a copy of your email in a document called "Review {{ week.number }}" in your homework folder.
</p>

<ul><li>A recap of what you taught.</li></ul>
<ul><li>Some resources you think your student(s) would benefit from studying. (Please consider carefully which resources you send them. In particular, what level of understanding do you want to target, and regarding what topics?) If you will see the same student(s) again, ask them to read and complete the relevant resources before then.</li></ul>
<ul><li>A link to the feedback form: <a href="{{ TUTORING_FEEDBACK }}">{{ TUTORING_FEEDBACK }}</a>.</li></ul>
