<p>Read <a href="https://www.quora.com/Do-grad-school-students-remember-everything-they-were-taught-in-college-all-the-time/answer/Mark-Eichenlaub?srid=xAq&amp;share=1">this Quora post written by Mark Eichenlaub</a> and make a two page outline of the topics discussed. It is long, so please put aside some time to read this. Some students in the past have read it in chunks.</p>
<p>After you finish your outline post a followup to the article in the #memory channel on Slack, and / or a thoughtful response to someone else's followup! There's a lot of insightful material in this reading for you to talk about.</p>

{% if week.resources['readings'] %}
  <h1 id="respond-to-the-readings">Respond to the readings</h1>
  <p>
    Make a post in the #readings channel on Slack, discussing one of <a href="{{ url_for(week.resources['readings']) }}">this week's readings</a> or responding to a post by one of your peers. You should lend something new and useful to the conversion. (For example you could explain how to apply something that you learned, or offer an argument for / against one of your peers' ideas. Any input is welcome, as long as it is original and respectful.)
  </p>
  <p>
    Also feel free to find a different article on your own, and respond to that instead of one of the readings. Just be sure to provide a link to it, so others can read it too.
