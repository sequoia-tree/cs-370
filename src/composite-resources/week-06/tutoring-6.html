<p>
  Here's the tutoring sign-up form for this week: <a href="{{ week.signup }}">{{ week.signup }}</a>. You must email your students by Saturday night.
</p>

<h1 id="assignment">Assignment</h1>

<ul>
<li>While you're lesson-planning, remember to carefully consider your explanations. Also think about the organization of your explanations and practice problems. The goal is to make everything as intuitive as possible.</li>
</ul>

<h1 id="journal-prompt">Journal prompt</h1>

<p>
  Respond to the prompts below, immediately after each of your appointments this week (discussion, group tutoring, or one-on-one tutoring). When you finish your last appointment, copy and paste your journal entry onto bCourses.
</p>

<ul>
  <li>Briefly summarize the appointment. (For example: How do you feel about it? Do you think the student was following? What signs let you pick up on this? What could you have done better? etc.)</li>
</ul>

<ul>
<li>
<p>How did you organize the lesson to be as intuitive as possible? What are some of the important decisions you made while lesson-planning? Did you have any really good explanations worth sharing? Think back to the models of learning that we saw at the beginning of the semester, in particular the zone of proximal development. How did you scaffold from known material to new material? What would you change about your lesson plan, if you had to explain the same topics again? Provide some examples from your appointment.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Review your tutoring journals from the past few weeks. What are 3 things you've been doing well in your appointments? Provide some examples that you're proud of. What are 3 things that you want to improve about your appointments? Provide some examples where you could've been better.</p>
</li>
</ul>

<p>
  Then take the time to read some of your peers' responses too, and reply to at least two of them. Lend something productive and insightful to the conversation. (For example, talk about what you would've done differently in their position, or whether you're going to adapt something similar for your own lessons. Maybe ask them something about their appointment, etc.)
</p>

<h1 id="review">Review</h1>

<p>
  After each appointment this week which you plan to count toward your <a href="{{ url_for('render_policies') }}#tutoring">teaching requirement</a>, compose an email that includes the following points. Then send it to the student(s) who attended. Also include a copy of your email in a document called "Review {{ week.number }}" in your homework folder.
</p>

<ul><li>A recap of what you taught.</li></ul>
<ul><li>Some resources you think your student(s) would benefit from studying. (Please consider carefully which resources you send them. In particular, what level of understanding do you want to target, and regarding what topics?) If you will see the same student(s) again, ask them to read and complete the relevant resources before then.</li></ul>
<ul><li>A link to the feedback form: <a href="{{ TUTORING_FEEDBACK }}">{{ TUTORING_FEEDBACK }}</a>.</li></ul>
