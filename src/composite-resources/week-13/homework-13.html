<h1 id="designing-resources">Designing resources</h1>
<p>Find a resource that helped you a lot in one of the CS classes you've taken here. Provide a link to the resource. What type of resource is it: an explanation of mechanics / edge cases, a walkthrough of a high-level problem, or a list of good practice exercises? Write 3 things it does well, that made you appreciate the resource as a student. Also list one or two things that you would improve about it now, as a teacher, and why.</p>

{% if week.resources['readings'] %}
  <h1 id="respond-to-the-readings">Respond to the readings</h1>
  <p>
    Make a post in the #readings channel on Slack, discussing one of <a href="{{ url_for(week.resources['readings']) }}">this week's readings</a> or responding to a post by one of your peers. You should lend something new and useful to the conversion. (For example you could explain how to apply something that you learned, or offer an argument for / against one of your peers' ideas. Any input is welcome, as long as it is original and respectful.)
  </p>
  <p>
    Also feel free to find a different article on your own, and respond to that instead of one of the readings. Just be sure to provide a link to it, so others can read it too.
