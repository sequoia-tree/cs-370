# Classification according to Bloom's taxonomy

Bloom's taxonomy is one of the most widely-known models of learning. We'll focus on a revised version from 2001 (the year, not the space odyssey). Read these two articles for a in-depth explanation of how it works:

* [Bloom’s Taxonomy from Vanderbilt CFT](https://cft.vanderbilt.edu/guides-sub-pages/blooms-taxonomy/)
* [Revised Bloom’s Taxonomy from Iowa State CELT](http://www.celt.iastate.edu/teaching/effective-teaching-practices/revised-blooms-taxonomy)

Now choose a lower-division CS course. Recall the exams you took in the class that you chose. Write down all the different types of questions that appeared on the exams, and classify them according to the revised taxonomy. Justify why you think your classification is correct. Remember, each question type very likely covers several levels of the taxonomy. What levels, and under what circumstances?

# A detailed application of Bloom's taxonomy

In this assignment, we'll focus on the knowledge dimension of the revised Bloom's taxonomy, which turns the pyramid model into a 2-dimensional Q*bert-esque shape. You should refer to the second reading above in order to complete this assignment.

First pick a code-writing problem from CS 61A, CS 61B, or CS 61C**. You may use discussions, past midterms, guerilla section worksheets, etc. In your homework submission please include a link to the question that you chose, and additionally copy / paste it for ease of reference. For that question, describe the necessary steps to solve it. Be as explicit as possible. Each step should be designed to gently guide a student toward the solution. Look out for common questions or misconceptions that students might have regarding the question. Then, for each step of the solution, identify where it falls on the new 2-D revision of Bloom's taxonomy. Justify why you think your classification is correct. Here are some good examples from past iterations of this assignment. You don't have to make yours exactly like these, but hopefully they give you an idea of what we expect:

* [Example 3](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1dIQ0feab7_5Lc8-ALGK0yuSJjwtNYA_uwOHWAw1usAI/edit?usp=sharing)

** If you pick CS 61C, I'm restricting you to C code only. No MIPS, RISC-V, or (for the enterprising and cruel) binary.
