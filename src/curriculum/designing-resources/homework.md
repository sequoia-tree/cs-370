# Designing resources

Find a resource that helped you a lot in one of the CS classes you've taken here. Provide a link to the resource. What type of resource is it: an explanation of mechanics / edge cases, a walkthrough of a high-level problem, or a list of good practice exercises? Write 3 things it does well, that made you appreciate the resource as a student. Also write 1 or 2 things that you would improve about it now, as a teacher.
