# Case study on the Socratic method

Read [The Socratic Method: Teaching by Asking Instead of by Telling](http://www.garlikov.com/Soc_Meth.html) and answer the following questions:

1. Why was this exercise effective in this instance? List your reasons and provide supporting examples.
2. Could you apply this to your own teaching (lab assisting, tutoring, or discussion)? Is there anything that you would have to change in order to use this technique effectively in the context of your own teaching?
3. Along the same lines, what are some of the limitations of this method? What are some challenges to using this teaching technique in a different setting?
