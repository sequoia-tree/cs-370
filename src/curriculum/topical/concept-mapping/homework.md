# Concept mapping a midterm problem

Search through past midterms / finals for a difficult problem that a student might ask you about during the upcoming week. Draw a concept map for the topics relevant to solving that problem. For each topic that you identify, discuss how it is related to the problem, and what questions you could ask in order to check whether a student knows how to apply the topic in the context of the problem.
