* Reflect on the progress you've made since the beginning of the course. What aspect of your teaching have you improved upon most? Try to list an example or two. What skills do you want to improve on more? Have you changed the way you structure your sections, or have you come to have a favorite technique?



* What's your favorite teaching moment of the semester? (For example, are you really happy with a particular explanation? Or did a student say something that just made your day?)
