* Reflect on your experience this week teaching students at different levels of understanding.
  * If you taught a group, discuss how comfortable your students felt with the material and how you addressed their differences in understanding. If your section was unbalanced, explain the steps that you took during (or after) the appointment to make sure your students got the information they needed. What could you do next time to tailor your section better to different parts of the distribution?
  * If you taught only one-on-ones, take note of how your sessions progressed depending on the student's level of understanding. For instance, were you more prepared to teach to students with high / low understanding? Did you find yourself teaching more conceptually to students of high understanding, or more procedurally toward students of low understanding? Why? Did you provide more guidance to the students of low understanding? How do you think that affected their ability to become independent with the material?
