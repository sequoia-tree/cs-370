* Consider how you phrased your interactions, and in particular your praise, during this appointment. How did you try to promote a growth mindset with your words? In light of learning about the growth mindset, did you notice yourself change the way you speak to your students?



* Think about a time during this semester when you interacted with a student who had a fixed mindset. What clues gave you the impression they had a fixed mindset? How did you deal with it? How would you deal with it differently in the future? Sometimes students are frustrated with a particular question and it is evident their fixed mindset is part of that frustration. Do you think it's more important to help them solve the problem they're stuck on, or to help them get into a growth mindset? Why?
