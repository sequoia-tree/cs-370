* One of the most important takeaways from this class is that lesson plans are not only useful, but also necessary. Good teaching does not happen off-the-cuff. Before your appointments this week (and for that matter, all your appointments ever) make a lesson plan for the material you plan to cover.
  * It doesn't (and shouldn't) be verbatim what you plan to say. Rather, it should serve as a reminder for what points you want to talk about. For a 1.5-hour appointment, a hand-written lesson plan usually comes out to 2 or 3 pages for me.
  * Come up with some material that you will cover if you finish early. The worst possibility is that you're sitting in front of your student(s), and you have no idea what to talk about. Please please please don't ever find yourself in a situation where you're Googling problems to talk about, during the actual tutoring appointment.
  * Prepare a wide variety of problems. You want to be prepared to teach basics, as well as advanced stuff. (Typically strive for two questions on fundamentals, two intermediate-level questions, and one or two advanced ones.)
  * That said, tutoring isn't all about the problems you cover. Also think about how you're going to explain things.
