* If you intend to schedule tutoring via CS 370 itself using the link above, here's how:
  * Write your name in the "Tutor" column at the left.
  * Email the student to set up a time and place. [Here's an example.]({{ SAMPLE_EMAIL }})
  * Update the "Time & Place" column, as well as the "Status" column. Keep these columns up-to-date.
  * You may want to book a room in Soda, Cory, Moffitt, Kresge, etc.
  * If the student doesn't reply within 24 hours, email someone else! We have a lot of demand, and can't afford to wait for a response that'll never come. If  they do reply later feel free to take the appointment, but you're under no obligation.
  * After the appointment, update the "Status" column on the spreadsheet.



* One of the most important takeaways from this class is that lesson plans are not only useful, but also necessary. Good teaching does not happen off-the-cuff. Before your appointments this week (and for that matter, all your appointments ever) make a lesson plan for the material you plan to cover.
  * It doesn't (and shouldn't) be verbatim what you plan to say. Rather, it should serve as a reminder for what points you want to talk about. For a 1.5-hour appointment, a hand-written lesson plan usually comes out to 2 or 3 pages for me.
  * Come up with some material that you will cover if you finish early. The worst possibility is that you're sitting in front of your student(s), and you have no idea what to talk about. Please please please don't ever find yourself in a situation where you're Googling problems to talk about, during the actual tutoring appointment.
  * Prepare a wide variety of problems. You want to be prepared to teach basics, as well as advanced stuff. (Typically strive for two questions on fundamentals, two intermediate-level questions, and one or two advanced ones.)
  * That said, tutoring isn't all about the problems you cover. Also think about how you're going to explain things.
