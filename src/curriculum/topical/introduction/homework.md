# Introduce yourself

Take the time to write a short (1 paragraph or so) introduction for yourself, and post it as a followup to the "Introductions" post on Piazza. Also reply to at least 2 other folks, to get to know them a bit. You're going to be learning and working with about half the people who are in this class, and now is your chance to say hello to them!

# Setup

In this class you will keep your homework assignments in a Google Drive folder, for which you must grant edit access to the staff:

* [cthunn@eecs.berkeley.edu](mailto:cthunn@eecs.berkeley.edu)
* [sequoia@berkeley.edu](mailto:sequoia@berkeley.edu)
* [btong@berkeley.edu](mailto:btong@berkeley.edu)

Please grant us access to the whole folder at once, rather than granting us access to each assignment individually. Also, keep in mind that week's homework assignment should correspond to one Google Doc within your homework folder. For example, you should write your responses to the following questions in a single Google Doc called "HW 01".
