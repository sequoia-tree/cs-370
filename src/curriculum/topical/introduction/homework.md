# Introduce yourself

Take the time now to write a short (one paragraph or so) introduction for yourself, and post it in the #random channel on Slack. Also reply to at least two other folks, to get to know them a bit. You're going to be learning and working with about half the people who are in this class, and now is your chance to say hello to them!

Please also add a profile picture on Slack by clicking your name and then "edit profile". This will make it easier for your classmates to remember you.

# Make a homework folder

In this class you will keep your homework assignments in a Google Drive folder, for which you must grant edit access to the staff:

* [cthunn@eecs.berkeley.edu](mailto:cthunn@eecs.berkeley.edu)
* [sequoia@berkeley.edu](mailto:sequoia@berkeley.edu)
* [btong@berkeley.edu](mailto:btong@berkeley.edu)

Please grant us access to the whole folder at once, rather than granting us access to each assignment individually. Also, keep in mind that each week's homework assignment should correspond to one Google Doc within your homework folder. For example, you should write your responses to the following questions in a single Google Doc called "HW {{ week.number }}".
