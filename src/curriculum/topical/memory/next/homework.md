# Exploring the role of memorization in learning

Read [this Quora post written by Mark Eichenlaub](https://www.quora.com/Do-grad-school-students-remember-everything-they-were-taught-in-college-all-the-time/answer/Mark-Eichenlaub?srid=xAq&share=1) and make a two page outline of the topics discussed. It is long, so please put aside some time to read this. Some students in the past have read it in chunks.

After you finish your outline post a followup to the article in the #memory channel on Slack, and / or a thoughtful response to someone else's followup! There's a lot of insightful material in this reading for you to talk about.
