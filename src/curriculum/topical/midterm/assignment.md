* This week, take some time before your first appointment to choose a particular teaching skill that you want to practice this week. Consider how you'll work this skill into your tutoring appointments. Think about what you'll do differently, in terms of the structure of your appointment, the way you explain things, the problems you go over, the way you interact with the student(s), what / when you write on the board, etc.
