* Before your appointment, come up some counterexamples for three or more common misconceptions regarding the concept you're teaching. (Recall from lecture the principles of a good counterexample â€” simple, memorable, and easily interpretable, to name a few.) Share these with your student(s) whenever is appropriate during your lesson.



* Be vigilant of misconceptions this week, like we learned in lecture!
  * Always ask students to justify their reasoning, whether they're right or wrong.
  * If they don't get the right answer _and_ correctly justify it, then use a counterexample to identify whether they have a misconception.
