* How did your goal-setting appointment go with your student(s)? Were they keen on the idea, or not? If not, did you justify it (for instance, with the education research we presented in lecture)? How was the goal-setting appointment structured? Did you come away with reasonable, actionable, measurable goals that they will be able to stick to? How did you encourage them to use the schedule that you came up with? For instance, will you be doing email check-ins with them for the next week or so? Would you do this for future students of yours who are struggling in the class?
