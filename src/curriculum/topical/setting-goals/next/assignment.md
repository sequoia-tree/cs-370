* Last week you held 10 to 15 minute appointments to set goals with some of your students. If you taught any of the same folks this time around, ask them how they are doing with the goals you made last week. (If you didn't teach any of the same folks, then just reach out via email to the students you helped last week.) Are they keeping track of their goals and sticking to them? Have there been any unforseen difficulties? Revise their goals with them if necessary.
