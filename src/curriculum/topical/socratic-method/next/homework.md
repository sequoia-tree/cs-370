# Practicing the Socratic method

While you're teaching this week (whether that's lab assisting, tutoring, or in office hours), help at least one student by asking questions only. Write down the questions and responses, as in last week's reading. (It may help to record the session and then transcribe it, so you don't impede your own teaching.) It doesn't have to be a long interaction, but hopefully it is one that you learn from. Document the interaction in a Piazza post with "[Homework 2] Your Name" as the title. Conclude the post with a short paragraph outlining your thoughts about the interaction. Please read other folks' posts as well; the goal is to gain experience, but also to see how others apply the Socratic method. You might pick up a useful tip or two.

See [here](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1JnQT68u2XOBtddCmaxvVsmns9pzbJBDibE_cOxv_-18/edit?usp=sharing) for an example, from way back when I was a lab assistant.
