# Practicing the Socratic method

While you're teaching this week (lab assisting, tutoring, or during office hours), help at least one student by asking questions only. Write down the questions and responses, as in last week's reading. (It may help to record the session and then transcribe it, so you don't impede your own teaching.) It doesn't have to be a long interaction, but hopefully it is one that you learn from.

Document the interaction in the #practicing-socratic channel on Slack. Conclude the post with a short paragraph outlining your thoughts about the interaction. Please read some other folks' posts as well; the goal is to gain experience, but also to see how others apply the Socratic method. You might pick up a useful tip or two.

See [here](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1JnQT68u2XOBtddCmaxvVsmns9pzbJBDibE_cOxv_-18/edit?usp=sharing) for an example, from way back when I was a lab assistant.
