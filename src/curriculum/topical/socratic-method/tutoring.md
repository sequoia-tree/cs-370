# Assignment

* Use the Socratic method at least a little bit in each of your appointments this week. Consider preparing some questions beforehand.

# Journal prompt

After each appointment this week (discussion, group tutoring, or one-on-one tutoring) respond to the following prompts in the  #journal-{{ week.number }} channel on Slack.

* Summarize the appointment. (For example: How do you feel about it? What did you cover? Do you think the student was following? What signs let you pick up on this? What could you have done better? etc.)
* What was your experience using the Socratic method this week? In what situations was it particularly good? Do you think it was beneficial for the student? Was it effective or ineffective? Why? What would you change about your usage of the Socratic method next time?

Then take the time to read some of your peers' responses too, and reply to at least two of them. Lend something productive and insightful to the conversation. (For example, talk about what you would've done differently in their position, or whether you're going to adapt something similar for your own lessons. Maybe ask them something about their appointment, etc.)
