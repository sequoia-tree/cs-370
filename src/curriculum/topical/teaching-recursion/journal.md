* How did you organize the lesson to be as intuitive as possible? What are some of the important decisions you made while lesson-planning? Did you have any really good explanations worth sharing? Think back to the models of learning that we saw at the beginning of the semester, in particular the zone of proximal development. How did you scaffold from known material to new material? What would you change about your lesson plan, if you had to explain the same topics again? Provide some examples from your appointment.
