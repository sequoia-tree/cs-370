# Teaching CS without a computer

Do some research on [CS Unplugged](https://csunplugged.org/en/), which is a program to teach computer science without computers. There's plenty of news about it, but [here's one article I particularly liked](http://www.slate.com/articles/technology/future_tense/2014/08/computer_science_unplugged_teaching_computational_thinking_without_computers.html).

* First analyze CS Unplugged through a pedagogical lense. What do you think about this program? How does it affect the way you teach computer science? How does it affect learning?
* Then consider the implications for accessibility. How could CS Unplugged empower students hailing from low-opportunity backgrounds, to pursue computer science?

Overall, what do you think this program is doing right or wrong? Do you support it, or are you against it?

# Harvard's implicit association test

Read about [Project Implicit](https://implicit.harvard.edu/implicit/education.html), which is a Harvard initiative to raise awareness and combat unconscious bias. Then [take one of Project Implicit's tests](https://implicit.harvard.edu/implicit/selectatest.html). Each test is designed to investigate your unconscious biases relating to one of many stereotypes prevalent throughout our society.

The point of this exercise is not to identify yourself or anyone else as mysogynist, racist, etc. Rather, the point is to help you recognize your own unconscious biases so that you can consciously mitigate them while teaching.

When you're done with the test, reflect briefly on your experience taking it.
