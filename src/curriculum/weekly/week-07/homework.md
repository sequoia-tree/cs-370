# Revisiting the growth mindset

In last week's lecture we talked about setting goals with your students. Specifically, we surveyed what makes a good goal, how to foster authentic motivation, and the role of hope in student success. In about a page, talk about how these ideas relate to the growth mindset. Specifically, how can we encourage a growth mindset using the goals that you set with your students? How does motivation — and in particular, the source of a student's motivation — relate to their learning mindset?

# The flipped classroom

In the same way we introduced guerrilla sections as a novel way to teach discussion, we want to introduce you to the flipped classroom format as a novel way to teach lecture. Plenty of folks (including Josh Hug) have experimented with this new way of teaching CS, and it's worth thinking carefully about in order to get a broader picture of what sorts of experiments are being done at the forefront of classroom design.
Read these two articles:

* [Rethinking the Lecture: In the Information Age, it’s Time to Flip the Classroom](http://www.wired.com/insights/2014/10/rethinking-the-lecture/)
* [Evidence on Flipped Classrooms is Still Coming in](http://www.ascd.org/publications/educational-leadership/mar13/vol70/num06/Evidence-on-Flipped-Classrooms-Is-Still-Coming-In.aspx)

Also read one of the following. (Or both! I'm not the boss of you.)

* [Computer Science for All (Really)](https://www.cs.princeton.edu/news/%E2%80%98computer-science-all%E2%80%99-really)
* [Computer Science Professors Experiment with Flipped Classrooms](http://www.thecrimson.com/article/2013/4/24/flipped-classrooms-computer-science/?page=single)

Then, in at least a page, answer these questions:

* What is the flipped classroom format?
* Why would you want to do it? What are your thoughts about it?
* What are some advantages and disadvantages to this format?
* In particular, are there any hopes and / or skepticisms that you hold about this method of teaching?
* How do you think it could be applied to CS 61A, CS 61B, or CS 61C? Do you think it would work well? Why or why not?
