# Revisiting the growth mindset

In last week's lecture we talked about setting goals with your students. Specifically, we surveyed what makes a good goal, how to foster authentic motivation, and the role of hope in student success. In about a page, talk about how these ideas relate to the growth mindset. Specifically, how can we encourage a growth mindset using the goals that you set with your students? How does motivation — and in particular, the source of a student's motivation — relate to their learning mindset?
