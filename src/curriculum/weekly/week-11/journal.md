* You were meant to pick an aspect of your teaching to focus on improving, with each appointment this week. What personal barriers make it hard for you to improve on this skill? In other words, what challenges do you face that make it difficult to put to use all the strategies covered in lecture? How did these barriers surface during your tutoring appointment? Provide some specific examples. (It may take a little reflection, but I guarantee you will be able to identify at least one personal barrier that affected your appointment. One personal barrier I had to overcome in my own teaching was that I used to be very shy, to a point that it was hard for me to tell students what to do even when it was in their own interest.)
