# TA shadowing

This week you'll be shadowing a TA's discussion section in CS 61A, CS 61B, or CS 61C! This is time sensitive, so please read through the rules now.

## When you're signin up to shadow

* Sign up to shadow a TA on this form. There can be a maximum of 3 people shadowing each discussion section, so sign up early for the discussion section you want.
* Mark the place and time on your calendar! Do not forget about the appointment you're shadowing!
* CS 61A discussion sections are 90 minutes long. Plan accordingly.
* Please review this week's material in advance for the class that you are shadowing, so you can follow along with the discussion section. It should be readily available on the class' website.

## When you're shadowing

* Introduce yourself to the TA before the section starts, so they know who you are. This requires that you show up a tiny bit early to the section.
* You are under no circumstances to talk to the TA or any of the students whatsoever during the section. Do not participate in the discussion section or influence it in any way.
* While shadowing, write up a page or two worth of notes about how the section went. Here are some things for you to think about. You don't have to answer them explicitly, but try to at least consider each of these points, and include something about it in your write-up.
  * How does the TA explain concepts or walk through problems? What techniques do you recognize?
  * How do they interact with the students?
  * What do they do really well? What would you have done in their place?
  * How do they structure the lesson?
  * How do they handle questions? What sort of questions do they ask, and why?
  * Do they use group work? In what circumstances, and why?
  * How do they balance lecture against practice? How do they manage their time?
  * Are the students engaged? How does the TA try to keep them busy?
  * How does the TA handle teaching to a section where some students know the material better than others? Do they focus on the middle of the distribution, cater to one end, or do they teach to everyone equally?
* When you finish, convert your notes into a review of the discussion session. There's no specific format: free-form, bullet list, etc are all fine. Put it in your homework folder. You do not have to disclose your review to the TA you shadowed, unless you want to do so.
