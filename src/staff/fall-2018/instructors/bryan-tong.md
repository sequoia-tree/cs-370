Hiya, I’m Bryan, the newest co-instructor and a senior studying CS + CogSci.  I grew up nearby in the East Bay (Pleasanton), where I’ll likely be hiding on weekends and hammering away on CS projects.  Professionally, I’ve been on course staff for CS 370, CS 61A, and CS 61C.  Aside from that, I run Virtual Reality @ Berkeley and lately advise directors in the ASUC on diversity and atmosphere in E&T.  Fun fact: I’m a recovering boba addict, though one of my dreams is to run a boba cafe.  Feel free to chat with me about: non-Vim-related CS, lifting, cooking, PlayStation games, and dogs.
