Howdy all! I'll be your primary point of contact for all things teaching-related and logistical. Feel free to contact me any time, 24/7 and I'll likely reply within the day. This is my fourth semester teaching CS 370, which means you all get to benefit from the new-and-improved curriculum that I designed over the break. I'm currently the Head of Teaching for CS 61A and in the past I've been the Head of Software, a frequent guest lecturer for CS Scholars, a DSEP connector associate, and via BIDS a curriculum developer for E7 and a new Scala class. I'm also redesigning the CS 9 series soon, with a new textbook, new curriculum, and new everything else. CS 186 is next on the list. If you're here teaching CS 61A, then you might find it useful to periodically have a look at [my textbook](https://sequoia-tree.github.io/) to review for your appointments and facilitate lesson-planning.
