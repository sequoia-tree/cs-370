Hi I am Asli! I am a junior studying computer science and economics. I am very excited to be a part of CS 370 this semester (not as much as you should be though). Other than CS 370, I have been teaching CS 70, CS 61A and this semester Iâ€™ll be a reader for CS 170 so hopefully I will see you around. Talk to me about food places, languages, TV shows, chess, and of course teaching and classes. I look forward to meeting you all!
