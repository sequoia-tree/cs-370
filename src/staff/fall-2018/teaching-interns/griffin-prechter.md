Hi, I'm Griffin, a junior from Los Angeles, CA! Teaching is a passion of mine, and I'm very excited to share it with you! I took CS 370 one year ago, and it helped make me the teacher I am today. Since then I've become a TA for CS 61A and joined CS Mentors. Now I'm thrilled to be involved with CS 370 again. In my spare time I like learning new things, cooking, baking, Shiba Inus, and maximizing gains. I'm looking forward to meeting and working with you all!
