Hello! I'm a second-year from the South Bay studying CS. Some of my skills include eating too much lychee until I get a nosebleed, drooling on my keyboard after falling asleep coding, and somehow managing to eat Imm Thai every day for two months. In my free time, I like to dance, read, and weight lift. Teaching has perhaps been one of the most fulfilling things I've done at Cal, so I'm excited to be able to share this experience with all of you.
