Hi I’m Rina! I’m currently a sophomore at UC Berkeley. I’m from Boston, MA, and I love everything from music to philosophy to computer science. I took CS 370 last semester and tutored for CS 61A. I also virtually advise high-achieving low income high school students to help them get into top colleges. Feel free to reach out to me about anything!
