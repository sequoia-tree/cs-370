Hi I'm Rina, currently a sophomore at UC Berkeley! I'm from Boston, MA, and I love everything from music to philosophy to computer science. Right now I am still undeclared, but I am leaning towards a double major in CS and English. I took CS 370 last semester and tutored for CS 61A. CS 61A was actually my first CS class ever! I also virtually advise high-achieving low income high school students to help them get into top colleges, and I'm part of UC Berkeley's student programming board. Feel free to reach out to me about anything, whether you need advice on teaching or just want to talk!
